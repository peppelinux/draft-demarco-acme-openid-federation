    Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) with OpenID
                             Federation 1.0
              draft-demarco-acme-openid-federation-latest

Abstract

   The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol
   allows server operators to obtain TLS certificates for their
   websites, based on a demonstration of control over the website's
   domain via a fully-automated challenge/response protocol.

   OpenID Federation 1.0 defines how to build a trust infrastructure
   using a trusted third-party model.  It uses a trust evaluation
   mechanism to attest to the possession of private keys, protocol
   specific metadata and miscellaneous administrative and technical
   information related to a specific entity.

   This document defines how X.509 certificates associated with a given
   OpenID Federation Entity can be issued by an X.509 Certification
   Authority through the ACME protocol to the organizations which are
   part of a federation built on top of OpenID Federation 1.0.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes extensions to the ACME protocol that
   integrate with OpenID Federation 1.0, allowing an ACME server to
   issue X.509 Certificates associated with a given OpenID Federation
   entity.  An entity can be a school, government agency, corporation,
   automated system, or any participant that wishes to join the
   Federation.

   In a multilateral federation, composed of thousands of entities
   belonging to different organizations, all the participants adhere to
   the same regulation or trust framework.  OpenID Federation 1.0 allows
   each participant to recognize other participants using a trust
   evaluation mechanism, with RESTful services and cryptographic
   materials.

   Federation members declare what kind Entities they are using a basic
   OpenID Federation component called an Entity Configuration, a signed
   JSON Web Token published in a well-known resource.  This document
   defines new OpenID Federation Entity Types for certificate Requestors
   and Issuers, facilitating automated discovery of an issuer's ACME
   API.

   X.509 Certificates can be provided to one or more such entities,
   without having pre-established any direct relationship or contract.

   These Certificates are useful for integrating with existing systems
   and protocols which require X.509 Certificates.  For example, RADIUS
   ([RFC2865]) deployments often require Certificates to authenticate
   clients, or these Certificates could also be used for TLS [RFC8446].
   In order to accommodate a variety of use cases, this document adds no
   requirement that CAs conform to any particular issuance profile,
   because fields of the X.509 Certificates like the Common Names,
   Subject Alternative Names or Key Usages may depend on details of
   those existing systems.

   This document extends [RFC5280], ACME ([RFC8555]) and OpenID
   Federation 1.0 ([OPENID-FED]) in the following ways:

   *  It defines a new ACME Identifier type called openid-federation
      (Section 4).

   *  It defines a new ACME challenge type called openid-federation-01
      (Section 5).

   *  It defines new OpenID Federation 1.0 Entity Types acme_issuer
      (Section 7.1) and acme_requestor (Section 6).

   *  It defines how OpenID Federation 1.0 Superior Entities can use
      Subordinate Statements to publish X.509 Certificates previously
      issued with ACME (Section 8).

   *  It defines a new SubjectAlternativeName type id-on-
      OpenIdFederationEntityId and a corresponding OID so that OpenID
      Federation 1.0 Entity Identifiers can be included in X.509
      Certificates if an Issuer wishes (Section 9).

2.  Terminology

   The terms "Federation Entity", "Trust Anchor", "Entity
   Configuration", "Subordinate Statement", "Superior Entity",
   "Immediate Superior Entity", "Federation Entity Keys", "Federation
   Entity Discovery", "Trust Mark", "Trust Chain", and "Resolved
   Metadata" used in this document are defined in Section 1.2 of
   [OPENID-FED].

   The term "Certificate Signing Request" (CSR) used in this document is
   defined as a "Certification Request" in [RFC2986].  The term
   "Certification Authority" used in this document is defined in
   [RFC5280].  The terms "ACME Client" and "ACME Server" are defined in
   [RFC8555].

   The specification also defines the following terms:

   ACME Identifier:  An identifier in the sense of [RFC8555].  Some
      identifier that the ACME client proves control of to the ACME
      server.

   Entity Identifier:  A URL that uniquely identifies an Entity in
      OpenID Federation, as defined in Section 1.2 of [OPENID-FED].

   Requestor:  A Federation Entity which wants to request X.509
      Certificates.  It operates a web server for hosting its Entity
      Configuration.  It also operates an ACME client, extended
      according to this document.

   Certificate Issuer (or Issuer):  A Federation Entity which issues
      X.509 Certificates.  It operates a web server for hosting its
      Entity Configuration.  It also operates an ACME server, extended
      according to this document.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  OpenID Federation ACME Identifier

   This document defines a new ACME Identifier type for OpenID
   Federation Entities, openid-federation, whose value is the sub
   parameter of the Requestor's Entity Configuration, as defined in
   Section 1.2 of [OPENID-FED].

   For example, the ACME Identifier corresponding to the example Entity
   Configuration in Section 6 is:

 {"type": "openid-federation", "value": "https://requestor.example.com"}

   The openid-federation ACME Identifier type MUST NOT be validated
   except by the openid-federation-01 challenge.

5.  OpenID Federation Challenge Type

   The OpenID Federation challenge type allows a Requestor to prove
   control of a Federation Entity using the trust evaluation mechanism
   provided by [OPENID-FED].  The Requestor demonstrates control of a
   cryptographic public key published in its OpenID Federation Entity
   Configuration.

   There are two ways the Certificate Issuer is able to check if a
   Requestor is part of the federation:

   *  The Requestor provides a Trust Chain when solving the ACME
      challenge.  This is RECOMMENDED since it reduces the effort of the
      Certificate Issuer in evaluating the trust to the Requestor.

   *  The Requestor doesn't provide a Trust Chain in the challenge
      solution.

   The openid-federation-01 ACME challenge object has the following
   format:

   type (required, string): The string "openid-federation-01"

   token (required, string): A random value that uniquely identifies the
   challenge.  This value MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy.  It
   MUST NOT contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet as
   described in Section 5 of [RFC4648].  Trailing '=' padding characters
   MUST be stripped.  See [RFC4086] for additional information on
   randomness requirements.

   trustAnchors (optional, array of string): An array of strings
   containing the Entity Identifiers of the Issuer's Trust Anchors.
   When solving the challenge, the Requestor can construct a Trust Chain
   from itself to one of these Trust Anchors.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   the Issuer includes this field to make it easier for the Requestor to
   construct a Trust Chain.

   A non-normative example of a challenge with trustAnchors specified:

      {
        "type": "openid-federation-01",
        "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4",
        "status": "pending",
        "token": "LoqXcYV8q5ONbJQxbmR7SCTNo3tiAXDfowyjxAjEuX0",
        "trustAnchors": [
          "https://trust-anchor-1.example.com",
          "https://trust-anchor-2.example.com"
        ]
      }

   The openid-federation-01 challenge MUST NOT be used to validate
   possession of any ACME Identifiers except openid-federation ACME
   Identifiers.

   The Requestor responds to the challenge with an object with the
   following format:

   sig (required, string): the compact JSON serialization (as described
   in Section 7.1 of [RFC7515]) of a JWS, signing the key authorization
   encoded in UTF-8.  The key authorization is computed from the token
   in the challenge and the Requestor's ACME account key, as defined in
   Section 8.1 of [RFC8555].  The signature must be made by one of the
   keys published in the Requestor's acme_requestor metadata in its
   Entity Configuration, as specified in Section 6.  The JWS MUST
   include a kid header parameter corresponding to the key used to sign
   the key authorization and a typ header parameter set to "signed-acme-
   challenge+jwt".

   trustChain (optional, array of string): an array of strings
   containing signed JWTs, representing a Trust Chain from the Requestor
   to one of the Issuer's Trust Anchors (see Section 4 of [OPENID-FED]).
   The Resolved Metadata of the Trust Chain subject MUST contain
   acme_requestor metadata that contains the key used to compute sig.
   It is RECOMMENDED that the Requestor includes this field.  If the
   Requestor cannot construct a Trust Chain to one of the Trust Anchors
   indicated by the Issuer, or if no Trust Anchors were indicated, it
   MAY use some other Trust Anchor that it believes the Issuer trusts.
   If the Requestor cannot construct a Trust Chain to any Trust Anchor,
   it MAY omit the trustChain field from the challenge response.

   A non-normative example for an authorization with trustChain
   specified:

      POST /acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4
      Host: issuer.example.com
      Content-Type: application/jose+json

      {
        "protected": base64url({
          "alg": "ES256",
          "kid": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
          "nonce": "UQI1PoRi5OuXzxuX7V7wL0",
          "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4"
        }),
        "payload": base64url({
         "sig": "wQAvHlPV1tVxRW0vZUa4BQ...",
         "trustChain": ["eyJhbGciOiJFU...", "eyJhbGci..."]
        }),
        "signature": "Q1bURgJoEslbD1c5...3pYdSMLio57mQNN4"
      }

   On receiving a challenge response, the Certificate Issuer verifies
   that the Requestor is trusted.  If the Requestor did not provide a
   trustChain, the Issuer MUST perform Federation Entity Discovery
   (Section 10 of [OPENID-FED]) to obtain a Trust Chain for the
   Requestor.

   Once it has obtained a Trust Chain, the Issuer evaluates the entity's
   Resolved Metadata, and verifies:

   *  That the requested openid-federation ACME Identifier value matches
      the sub parameter of the Requestor's Entity Configuration.

   *  That there is a key in the acme_requestor metadata (Section 6) of
      the Requestor's Resolved Metadata with a kid matching the kid
      claim in the challenge response.

   *  That the sig field of the payload is the compact JSON
      serialization of a valid JWS signing the key authorization, using
      the above public key.

   If all of the above checks succeed, then the validation is
   successful.  Otherwise, it has failed.  In either case, the
   Certificate Issuer responds according to Section 7.5.1 of [RFC8555].
   If the Issuer fails to verify OpenID Federation trust, the problem
   document SHOULD contain a subproblem of type
   urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationEntity constructed as
   discussed in Section 11.

   A non-normative example for the challenge object post-validation:

      {
        "type": "openid-federation-01",
        "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4",
        "status": "valid",
        "validated": "2024-10-01T12:05:13.72Z",
        "token": "LoqXcYV8q5ONbJQxbmR7SCTNo3tiAXDfowyjxAjEuX0"
      }

6.  Requestor Entity Configuration Metadata

   The Requestor MUST publish in its Entity Configuration an
   acme_requestor metadata containing a JWK set, according to
   Section 5.2.1 of [OPENID-FED].  The keys in the set are used to
   respond to ACME challenges.

   The following is a non-normative example of an Entity Configuration
   including the acme_requestor metadata and using the jwks metadata
   parameter.

{
  "iss": "https://requestor.example.com",
  "sub": "https://requestor.example.com",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516298022,
  "jwks": {
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig",
        "kid": "NzbLsXh8uDCcd-6MNwXF4W_7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs",
        "n": "pnXBOusEANuug6ewezb9J_...",
        "e": "AQAB"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "acme_requestor": {
      "jwks": {
        "keys": [
          {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "kid": "SUdtUndEWVY2cUFDeD...",
            "n": "y_Zc8rByfeRIC9fFZrD...",
            "e": "AQAB"
          },
          {
            "kty": "EC",
            "kid": "MFYycG1raTI4SkZvVDBIMF9CNGw3VEZYUmxQLVN2T21nSWlkd3",
            "crv": "P-256",
            "x": "qAOdPQROkHfZY1daGofOmSNQWpYK8c9G2m2Rbkpbd4c",
            "y": "G_7fF-T8n2vONKM15Mzj4KR_shvHBxKGjMosF6FdoPY"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

   The Issuer MUST only use the Requestor's acme_requestor to validate
   an ACME challenge.  Therefore, after completing the challenge, the
   Requestor MAY remove the acme_requestor metadata from its Entity
   Configuration.

7.  Issuer Discovery

   The Requestor's ACME client may either be configured to use a
   particular ACME server, or to automatically discover a Certificate
   Issuer through the OpenID Federation.

   In order to be discoverable, the Issuer MUST publish the entity type
   acme_issuer in its Entity Configuration, according to Section 7.1.

   [OPENID-FED] describes a variety of patterns and generic mechanisms
   for discovering Federation Entities.  This section describes how
   Issuers may make themselves discoverable in a Federation by
   Requestors.

   TODO: include a specific section reference once
   https://github.com/openid/federation/pull/265 lands in OPENID-FED

7.1.  Issuer Metadata

   The Issuer MUST publish its Entity Configuration including the
   acme_issuer Entity Type metadata within it.  The acme_issuer metadata
   contains one parameter, directory_url, which is the URL of the ACME
   Directory, as defined in Section 7.1.1 of [RFC8555].

   Requestors MUST use the ACME Directory provided in the Issuer's
   Entity Configuration for client configuration of ACME endpoints.

   The following is a non-normative example of an Entity Configuration
   including the acme_issuer metadata:

   {
     "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "sub": "https://issuer.example.com",
     "iat": 1516239022,
     "exp": 1516298022,
     "jwks": {
       "keys": [
         {
           "kty": "RSA",
           "alg": "RS256",
           "use": "sig",
           "kid": "NzbLsXh8uDCcd-6MNwXF4W_7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs",
           "n": "pnXBOusEANuug6ewezb9J_...",
           "e": "AQAB"
         }
       ]
     },
     "metadata": {
       "acme_issuer": {
         "directory_url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/directory"
       }
     }
   }

8.  Publication of the Certificates within the Federation

   The X.509 Certificates issued by federation Immediate Superior
   Entities pertaining to one or more Federation Entity Keys in control
   of their Subordinates MAY publish this information by including the
   x5c member in each JWK contained within the matching Subordinate
   Statement.  The contents of the published x5c member, including
   whether it contains a full or partial Trust Chain, and if so, to what
   Trust Anchor, are policy decisions out of scope for this document.

9.  CSR and Certificate Fields

   Depending on the Certificate Issuer's X.509 Certificate profile, the
   CSR and X.509 Certificate MAY associate the X.509 Certificate to the
   Federation Entity by including the Entity Identifier in the X.509
   Certificate.

   To do so, the Issuer includes a Subject Alternative Name extension
   containing an otherName with a type-id of id-on-
   OpenIdFederationEntityId.  The value of the name is an Octet String
   containing the UTF-8 encoding of the Entity Identifier (i.e., the URI
   in the corresponding openid-federation ACME Identifier from the
   newOrder request).

      id-on-OpenIdFederationEntityId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on XXX }

      OpenIdFederationEntityId ::= UTF8String

10.  Certificate Lifecycle

   The identity of the Requestor is verified through proof of possession
   of a private key corresponding to a public key attested within a
   Trust Chain.  The Trust Chain has an expiration time, and its content
   MUST NOT be trusted past the expiration time (Section 10.2 of
   [OPENID-FED]).

   The notBefore and notAfter fields of issued certificates MUST
   represent dates before the Trust Chain's expiration time.  If the
   Requestor's newOrder request (Section 7.4 of [RFC8555]) contains
   notAfter or notBefore fields that make this impossible, the
   Certificate Issuer MUST reply with an error of type
   urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationCertificateValidity.

11.  Errors

   This document defines two new error type URIs to be used in problem
   documents [RFC9457], as described in Section 6.7 of [RFC8555].

   The error type urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationEntity is
   used to encapsulate any OAuth error code returned while resolving
   OpenID Federation Entities.  The title of this error type is "OpenID
   Federation Error".  The detail member of the problem document MAY
   include the description of the particular OAuth error code that
   caused the error.  The problem document for this error type SHOULD
   include an extension member named error_code, which MUST be set to
   the OAuth error code, taken from the error codes defined in
   Section 8.9 of [OPENID-FED].

   The error type
   urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationCertificateValidity is
   used to indicate that a Certificate could not be issued because of a
   mismatch between the requested period of validity and the expiration
   of the OpenID Federation Trust Chain.

12.  Security Considerations

   The openid-federation-01 challenge defined in Section 5 defends
   against replay attacks by malicious ACME servers because the
   signature in challenge responses is over an ACME key authorization,
   which binds the ACME account key.

   The cryptographic keys in the acme_requestor metadata SHOULD NOT be
   reused for other purposes than signing responses to acme-
   federation-01 challenges.  For example, the same keys SHOULD NOT be
   reused in the issued X.509 Certificate.  If the keys are reused for
   other purposes, cross-protocol attacks MUST be considered.

   The cryptographic keys in the acme_requestor metadata SHOULD be
   rotated periodically.

13.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly asked to make the following updates to registries:

13.1.  ACME Registry Group

   The following updates are all assignments in the "Automated
   Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Protocol" registry group

Appendix A.  End-to-end Issuance Flow

   ~~~ BEGIN EDNOTE ~~~

   This appendix is to be removed before publication.

   This section contains explanatory material that recaps a lot of RFC
   8555.  It is included here for the benefit of readers who are
   familiar with OpenID Federation but not with ACME, and want to see at
   a glance how the whole thing fits together.

   The following diagram illustrates a successful interaction between
   Issuer and Requestor to retrieve an X.509 Certificate.  The diagram
   assumes the Requestor has already discovered the Issuer, and the
   Requestor has already created an ACME account with the Issuer.

   This section is informational and non-normative.  The remainder of
   this document, [RFC8555] and [OPENID-FED] should be considered
   correct should this appendix disagree with any of them.
