--- abstract

The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol
allows server operators to obtain TLS certificates for their websites,
based on a demonstration of control over the website's domain via a
fully-automated challenge/response protocol.

OpenID Federation 1.0 defines how to build a trust infrastructure using a
trusted third-party model. It uses a trust evaluation mechanism to attest the
possession of private keys, protocol specific metadata and miscellaneous
administrative and technical information related to a specific entity.

This document defines how X.509 certificates associated with a given OpenID
Federation Entity can be issued by an X.509 Certification Authority through the
ACME protocol to the organizations which are part of a federation built on top
of OpenID Federation 1.0.

# Introduction

This document describes extensions to the ACME protocol that integrate with
OpenID Federation 1.0, allowing an ACME server to issue X.509 Certificates
associated with a given OpenID Federation Entity.

X.509 Certificates can be provided to one or more organizations,
without having pre-established any direct relationship or contract.

In a multilateral federation, composed of thousands of entities belonging to
different organizations, all the participants adhere to the same regulation or
trust framework. OpenID Federation 1.0 allows each participant to recognize
other participants using a trust evaluation mechanism, with RESTful services and
cryptographic materials.

Federation members declare what kind Entities they are using a basic OpenID
Federation component called an Entity Configuration, a signed JSON Web Token
published in a well-known resource. This document defines new OpenID Federation
Entity Types for certificate requestors and issuers, facilitating automated
discovery of an issuer's ACME API.

The new ACME challenge type defined in this document facilitates automated
issuance of X.509 Certificates to requestors that can prove to a certificate
issuer that they are trusted OpenID Federation 1.0 entities. This document
extends the ACME protocol in the following ways:

- It associates a cryptographic key with an OpenID Entity, rather than a domain,
  since the authentication and authorization of the requestor is asserted with
  OpenID Federation 1.0.

- It defines how the OpenID Federation Subordinate Statements can be used for the
  publication of the X.509 Certificates, by a Superior Entity, that
  were previously issued with ACME.

- It extends the ACME newOrder resource, as defined in
  {{Section 7.4 of !RFC8555}}, defining a new identifier type called
  `openid-federation`.

# Target Audience and Use Cases

The audience of the document are the multilateral federations that require
automatic issuance of X.509 Certificates using an infrastructure of trust based
on OpenID Federation 1.0.

This specification can be implemented by:

- Federation Entities that join a federation to attest themselves as
  trustworthy, and then retrieve X.509 Certificates for their official HTTPS
  Federation Entity ID.

- Federation Entities that want to ask for and obtain X.509 Certificates for use
  in other protocols.

# Terminology

The terms "Federation Entity", "Trust Anchor", "Entity Configuration",
"Subordinate Statement", "Superior Entity", "Immediate Superior Entity",
"Federation Entity Keys", "Federation Entity Discovery", "Trust Mark", "Trust
Chain", and "Resolved Metadata" used in this document are defined in
{{Section 1.2 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-1.2"}.

The term "Certificate Signing Request" (CSR) used in this document is defined as
a "Certification Request" in {{!RFC2986}}. The term "Certification Authority"
used in this document is defined in {{!RFC5280}}. The terms "ACME Client" and
"ACME Server" are defined in {{!RFC8555}}.

The specification also defines the following terms:

Requestor:
: A Federation Entity which wants to request X.509 certificates. It operates
  a web server for hosting its Entity Configuration. It also operates an ACME
  client, extended according to this document.

Certificate Issuer (or Issuer):
: A Federation Entity which issues X.509 certificates. It operates a web server
  for hosting its Entity Configuration. It also operates an ACME server,
  extended according to this document.

# Protocol Flow

The protocol flow consists of the following phases:

- **Discovery**: the Requestor discovers the available Certificate Issuers
  within a federation, inspecting the ACME issuer Entity types. This is
  discussed in {{discovery}}.
- **Issuance**: the Requestor requests a X.509 Certificate from a Certificate
  Issuer using the ACME protocol. The necessary extensions to ACME orders and
  challenges are discussed in {{neworder-request}} and {{challenge-type}},
  respectively.

There are two ways the Certificate Issuer is able to check if a Requestor is
part of the federation:

- The Requestor provides a Trust Chain when solving the ACME challenge. This is
  RECOMMENDED since it reduces the effort of the Certificate Issuer in
  evaluating the trust to the Requestor.

- The Requestor doesn't provide a Trust Chain in the challenge solution. The
  Certificate Issuer MUST start Federation Entity Discovery as described in
  {{Section 9 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-9"}.

The following diagram illustrates a successful interaction between Issuer and
Requestor to retrieve an X.509 Certificate. The diagram assumes the Requestor
has already discovered the Issuer, and the Requestor has already created an
ACME account with the Issuer.

## Preconditions

The protocol requires the following preconditions are met.

1. The Requestor and the Issuer MUST publish their Entity Configuration as
   defined in {{Section 9 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-9"}.

2. The Issuer MUST implement an ACME server, extended according to this document.

3. The Requestor MUST publish the entity type `acme_requestor` in its Entity
   Configuration, according to {{requestor-metadata}}.

4. The Issuer MUST publish the entity type `acme_issuer` in its Entity
   Configuration, according to {{issuer-metadata}}.

## Discovery

The Requestor's ACME client may either be configured to use a particular ACME
server, or to automatically discover a Certificate Issuer through the
federation.

Requestors that use discovery MAY select any Entity with an Entity type of
`acme_issuer`, or they may additionally require that such entities have a
valid Trust Mark with a particular Trust Mark Identifier.

## Entity Configuration Metadata

This section describes the metadata a Requestor and Issuer MUST publish in their
respective Entity Configurations.

### Issuer Metadata

The Issuer MUST publish its Entity Configuration including the `acme_issuer`
Entity Type metadata within it. The `acme_issuer` metadata contains one parameter,
`directory_url`, which is the URL of the ACME Directory, as defined in
{{Section 7.1.1 of !RFC8555}}.

Requestors MUST use the ACME Directory provided in the Issuer's Entity
Configuration for client configuration of ACME endpoints.

The following is a non-normative example of an Entity Configuration including
the `acme_issuer` metadata:

~~~~
{
  "iss": "https://issuer.example.com",
  "sub": "https://issuer.example.com",
  "iat": 1516239022,

  "jwks": {
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "alg": "RS256",
        "use": "sig",
        "kid": "NzbLsXh8uDCcd-6MNwXF4W_7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs",
        "n": "pnXBOusEANuug6ewezb9J_...",
        "e": "AQAB"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "acme_issuer": {
      "directory_url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/directory"
    }
  }
}
~~~~

### Requestor Metadata

The Requestor MUST publish in its Entity Configuration an `acme_requestor`
metadata containing a JWK set, according to
{{Section 5.2.1 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-5.2.1"}.
The keys in the set are used to respond to ACME challenges.

The following is a non-normative example of an Entity Configuration including
the `acme_requestor` metadata and using the `jwks` metadata parameter.

~~~~
{
  "iss": "https://requestor.example.com",
  "sub": "https://requestor.example.com",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "exp": 1516298022,
  "jwks": {
    "keys": [
      {

        "n": "pnXBOusEANuug6ewezb9J_...",
        "e": "AQAB"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "acme_requestor": {
      "jwks": {
        "keys": [
          {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "kid": "SUdtUndEWVY2cUFDeD...",
            "n": "y_Zc8rByfeRIC9fFZrD...",
            "e": "AQAB"
          },
          {

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~~

The Issuer MUST only use the Requestor's `acme_requestor` to validate an ACME
challenge. Therefore, after completing the challenge, the Requestor MAY remove
the `acme_requestor` metadata from its Entity Configuration.

## OpenID Federation Identifier {#identifier-type}

This document defines a new ACME identifier type for OpenID Federation entities, `openid-federation`,
whose value is the `sub` parameter of the requestor's Entity Configuration,
as defined in {{Section 1.2 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-1.2"}.

## newOrder Request

The Requestor begins certificate issuance by sending a HTTP POST request to the
Issuer's `newOrder` resource, as specified in {{Section 7.4 of !RFC8555}}.

A non-normative example of an ACME newOrder request:

~~~~
   POST /acme/new-order HTTP/1.1
   Host: issuer.example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
       "nonce": "5XJ1L3lEkMG7tR6pA00clA",

     }),
     "payload": base64url({
       "identifiers": [
         {
           "type": "openid-federation",
           "value": "https://requestor.example.com"
         }
       ],

     }),
     "signature": "H6ZXtGjTZyUnPeKn...wEA4TklBdh3e454g"
   }
~~~~

## OpenID Federation Challenge Type {#challenge-type}

The OpenID Federation challenge type allows a Requestor to prove control of a
Federation Entity using the trust evaluation mechanism provided by
{{OPENID-FED}}. The Requestor demonstrates control of a cryptographic public key
published in its OpenID Federation Entity Configuration.

The openid-federation-01 ACME challenge object has the following format:

type (required, string):  The string "openid-federation-01"

token (required, string):  A random value that uniquely identifies the
    challenge. This value MUST have at least 128 bits of entropy. It MUST NOT
    contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet as described in
    {{Section 5 of !RFC4648}}. Trailing '=' padding characters MUST be stripped.
    See {{!RFC4086}} for additional information on randomness requirements.

trustAnchors (optional, array of string):  An array of strings containing
    Entity Identifiers of the Issuer's Trust Anchors. When solving the
    challenge, the Requestor can construct a Trust Chain from itself to one of
    these Trust Anchors. It is RECOMMENDED that the Issuer includes this field
    to make it easier for the Requestor to construct a Trust Chain.

A non-normative example of a challenge with `trustAnchors` specified:

~~~~
   {
     "type": "openid-federation-01",
     "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4",
     "status": "pending",
     "token": "LoqXcYV8q5ONbJQxbmR7SCTNo3tiAXDfowyjxAjEuX0",
     "trustAnchors": [
       "https://trust-anchor-1.example.com",
       "https://trust-anchor-2.example.com"
     ]
   }
~~~~

The `openid-federation-01` challenge MUST NOT be used to issue X.509 Certificates
for any identifiers except `openid-federation` identifiers.

The `openid-federation` identifier MUST NOT be validated except by the
`openid-federation-01` challenge.

The Requestor responds to the challenge with an object with the following format:

sig (required, string):  the compact JSON serialization (as described in
    {{Section 7.1 of !RFC7515}}) of a JWS, signing the key authorization
    encoded in UTF-8.
    The key authorization is computed from the token in the challenge and the
    Requestor's ACME account key, as defined in {{Section 8.1 of !RFC8555}}.
    The signature must be made by one of the keys published in the Requestor's
    `acme_requestor` metadata in its Entity Configuration, as specified in
    {{requestor-metadata}}.
    The JWS MUST include a `kid` header parameter corresponding to the key used
    to sign the key authorization and a `typ` header parameter set to
    "signed-acme-challenge+jwt".

trustChain (optional, array of string):  an array of strings containing signed
    JWTs, representing a Trust Chain from the Requestor to one of the Issuer's
    Trust Anchors (see {{Section 4 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-4"}).
    The Resolved Metadata of the Trust Chain subject MUST contain
    `acme_requestor` metadata that contains the key used to compute `sig`.
    It is RECOMMENDED that the Requestor includes this field.
    If the Requestor cannot construct a Trust Chain to one of the Trust Anchors
    indicated by the Issuer, or if no Trust Anchors were indicated, it MAY use
    some other Trust Anchor that it believes the Issuer trusts.
    If the Requestor cannot construct a Trust Chain to any Trust Anchor, it MAY
    omit the `trustChain` field from the challenge response.

A non-normative example for an authorization with `trustChain` specified:

~~~~
   POST /acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4
   Host: issuer.example.com
   Content-Type: application/jose+json

   {
     "protected": base64url({
       "alg": "ES256",
       "kid": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/acct/evOfKhNU60wg",
       "nonce": "UQI1PoRi5OuXzxuX7V7wL0",
       "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4"
     }),
     "payload": base64url({
      "sig": "wQAvHlPV1tVxRW0vZUa4BQ...",
      "trustChain": ["eyJhbGciOiJFU...", "eyJhbGci..."]
     }),
     "signature": "Q1bURgJoEslbD1c5...3pYdSMLio57mQNN4"
   }
~~~~

On receiving a challenge response, the Certificate Issuer verifies that the
Requestor is trusted. If the Requestor did not provide a `trustChain`, the
Issuer MUST perform Federation Entity Discovery
({{Section 10 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-10"}) to obtain a Trust Chain
for the Requestor.

Once it has obtained a Trust Chain, the Issuer evaluates the entity's Resolved
Metadata, and verifies:

* That the requested `openid-federation` identifier value matches the `sub`
  parameter of the Requestor's Entity Configuration.

* That there is a key in the `acme_requestor` metadata ({{requestor-metadata}})
  of the Requestor's Resolved Metadata with a `kid` matching the `kid` claim in
  the challenge response.

* That the `sig` field of the payload is the compact JSON serialization of a
  valid JWS signing the key authorization, using the above public key.

If all of the above checks succeed, then the validation is successful.
Otherwise, it has failed. In either case, the Certificate Issuer responds
according to {{Section 7.5.1 of !RFC8555}}. If the Issuer fails to verify OpenID
Federation trust, the problem document SHOULD contain a subproblem of type
`urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationEntity` and the error code
`invalid_trust_chain`
({{Section 8.9 of OPENID-FED}}{: relative="#section-8.9"}).

A non-normative example for the challenge object post-validation:

~~~~
   {
     "type": "openid-federation-01",
     "url": "https://issuer.example.com/acme/chall/prV_B7yEyA4",
     "status": "valid",
     "validated": "2024-10-01T12:05:13.72Z",
     "token": "LoqXcYV8q5ONbJQxbmR7SCTNo3tiAXDfowyjxAjEuX0"
   }
~~~~

### CSR and Certificate Fields {#openidfed-othername-id}

Depending on the Certificate Issuer's X.509 Certificate profile, the CSR and
X.509 Certificate MAY associate the X.509 Certificate to the Federation Entity by
including the Entity ID in the X.509 Certificate.
To do so, the Issuer includes a Subject Alternative Name extension
containing an `otherName` with
a `type-id` of `id-on-OpenIdFederationEntityId`.
The value of the name is an Octet String
containing the UTF-8 encoding of the Entity ID
(i.e., the URI in the corresponding `openid-federation` identifier
from the `newOrder` request).

~~~~
   id-on-OpenIdFederationEntityId OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on XXX }

   OpenIdFederationEntityId ::= UTF8String
~~~~

# Publication of the Certificates within the Federation

The X.509 Certificates issued by federation Immediate Superior Entities
pertaining to one or more Federation Entity Keys in control of their
Subordinates MAY publish this information by including the `x5c` member
in each JWK contained within the matching Subordinate Statement. The contents
of the published `x5c` member, including whether it contains a full or
partial Trust Chain, and if so, to what Trust Anchor, are policy decisions
out of scope for this document.

# Certificate Lifecycle and Revocation

The identity of the Requestor is verified through proof of possession of a
private key corresponding to a public key
attested within a Trust Chain. It is up to the Certificate Issuer to decide
the expiration time of the X.509 Certificate. In some cases, and when required,
it MAY be set to match the expiration of the Trust Chain.

A Requestor SHOULD request the revocation of its X.509 Certificate when the related
cryptographic material is revoked. The Requestor SHOULD publish the revoked or
expired cryptographic keys in the Federation Historical Key Registry.

The X.509 Certificate revocation request is defined in {{Section 7.6 of !RFC8555}}.

# Errors {#error-type}

This document defines one new error type URI to be used in problem documents
{{!RFC9457}}, as described in {{Section 6.7 of !RFC8555}}.

The error type `urn:ietf:params:acme:error:openIDFederationEntity` can
be used to encapsulate any OAuth error code returned while resolving OpenID
Federation Entities. The title of this error type is "OpenID Federation Error".
The `detail` member of the problem document MAY include the description of the
particular OAuth error code that caused the error. The problem document for this
error type SHOULD include an extension member named `error_code`. The
`error_code` member SHOULD be set to the OAuth error code, taken from the IANA
"OAuth Extensions Error Registry" {{IANA-OAUTH}}.

# Security Considerations

The `openid-federation-01` challenge defined in {{challenge-type}} defends
against replay attacks by malicious ACME servers because the signature in
challenge responses is over an ACME key authorization, which binds the ACME
account key.

The cryptographic keys in the `acme_requestor` metadata SHOULD NOT be reused
for other purposes than signing responses to `acme-federation-01` challenges.
For example, the same keys SHOULD NOT be reused in the issued X.509 Certificate.
If the keys are reused for other purposes, cross-protocol attacks MUST be
considered.

The cryptographic keys in the `acme_requestor` metadata SHOULD be rotated
periodically.

# IANA Considerations
